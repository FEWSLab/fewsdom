\title{Validate Tea Absorbance}
\usage{
validate_tea_absorbance(abs_df, model = "default", fail_threshold = 0.1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{abs_df}{data.frame of sample absorbances from the absorbance_read function}

\item{model}{the comparison model of tea absorbance}

\item{fail_threshold}{user adjustable threshold to determine failure of the
tea absorbance validation procedure. Must be a decimal between 0 and 1. The value
is the minimum percent of the absorbance curve that is outside the error bar
for validation failure. For example if the value is 0.15, then the check fails
if > 15% of the sample absorbance curve is outside the modeled error bars.
Defaults to 0.10.}
}
\value{
returns a data.frame with pass/fail results of tea standard checks
}
\description{
Validates the absorbance of sample tea standards compared to a mean of good
tea standards run in the past on the instrument. Returns an error if the sample
absorbance curve is outside the fail threshold, and a warning if inside the fail
threshold but not fully within historical error bars.
}
\section{Default tea absorbance model}{


If model = "default", the model included in the package is used to validate
absorbance. The included model is the repeated absorbance of a 1% Unsweetened
Pure Leaf Black Tea solution created following USGS SRMtea method. See
https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2018/1096/ofr2018.1096.pdffor further explanation of
SRMtea standard.
